				<h3>information</h3>

				<p>
					The benefits of floatation are endless. This is the ultimate in
					relaxation for the mind and body. Body Check recommend a minimum
					course of of 3 floats as an introductory period. This is because
					the sensation improves dramatically after the intial floatation
					session. Any reservations a person may have concerning floating
					are lifted after the first float, allowing the second float to be
					a much more relaxed experience. The sensation will simply continue
					to improve after each session.
				</p>
				<p>
					To create an atmosphere of weightlessness in the floatation pod
					we mix almost 700lbs of Epson salts to 170 gallons of water, creating
					a 10" deep solution in the pod. This salted water is then heated
					to approx 35Â°C (body temperature).
				</p>
				<p>
					When you lay flat in the pod your body will be completely free from
					the forces of gravity. With your body laying in a weightless state,
					every single muscle in your body is free from tension and able to
					totally relax. Only during a floatation session is this possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lying in complete peace and tranquility allows your body and mind to
					switch off and find a level of relaxation that cannot be reached by
					normal traditional methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is well known that sleep is essential to good health. Our bodies
					need sleep and rest to allow the body to recuperate. Floatation therapy
					is even more relaxing due to the lack of pressure on the body. This
					deep relaxed state allows the body to recover from stress, pain is
					then relieved and blood flow stimulated. The body's natural pain
					killers (endorphins) are released during this state of relaxation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Controlled tests have shown that athletic performance is improved by
					floating before an event. Improvements due to regular floatation therapy
					have produced improved results in the following areas:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Stress and anxiety: confirmed improvements due to floatation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Study: students report better memory for facts and higher levels of concentration. Creativity is generally improved.
					</li>
					<li>
						Joint pain: problems like arthritis can be relieved for longer periods due to floatation.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>what to expect</h3>

				<p class="top-e">
					We want your floatation experience to be a great one. The session
					itself will take an hour, but you will need to shower before and
					after your float.
				</p>
				<p>
					On your first visit a demonstration will take place. As you enter
					the float room, relaxing music will be playing. After taking a shower
					you are free to enter the pod. Once settled, you will quickly adapt
					to your gravity-free environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					After an hour of floating, soft music will gently awaken you from
					your dreamy state. You can then shower and change. When ready please
					feel free to come to the reception and relax with a complimentary drink.
				</p>

				<h3>faq</h3>

				<p class="top-q">
					<span>Q: Will I feel claustrophobic?</span>
					<br>A: This is the question everyone asks. The answer is that it is very
					unlikely as you are always in control of the pod. The float can be
					taken with the lights on or off, and the pod door can be opened or
					closed from inside the pod. Music can be continuous or turned off.
					Whatever you want - you get!
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Q: Is it clean?</span>
					<br>A: Extremely. Nothing harmful can live in such salty water. After
					every session the contents of the pod are filtered and purified.
					The tank is totally clean and sterile - much healthier than your
					local swimming pool!
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Q: Could I drown if I fall asleep?</span>
					<br>A: No. The buoyancy of the salty water makes it impossible for you
					to go beneath the surface. You are totally safe.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Q: What do I need to bring with me?</span>
					<br>A: Bring a swimming costume with you. The door to your room is closed
					and your privacy assured. Bring your own toiletries if you wish,
					although we do have our own. Please bring your own towels.
					Please remember to refrain from shaving your body on the day of
					your floatation session, as the salt water will cause irritation
					during your floatation session.
				</p>
				<p class="bot-q">
					<span>Q: How often should I float?</span>
					<br>A: It sounds like a sales trick, but you will definitely benefit from
					regular sessions. Your first float will feel slightly awkward to start
					with; this is why we strongly recommend you take advantage of a starter
					pack of 3 sessions. By your second float you will be totally at ease
					with the situation and the benefits will be evident. The first stage
					of relaxation will arrive much quicker the more you float. The quicker
					you relax the greater the experience. For best results we recommend
					that you float with the lights off and the pod roof closed, but this
					is entirely up to you. The more you float, the more comfortable with
					the surroundings you will become.
